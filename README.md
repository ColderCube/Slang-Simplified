# Slang-Simplified
 This is c++ version of Slang.It is made in c++17. It provides memory safety for the code which the other didn't.
 It is currently in development.
 Planning to use llvm backed to generate code and also planning to make a virtual machine to it.

# Note
It contains MSVS solutions so you could directly use or clone the repository run it with c++17.
